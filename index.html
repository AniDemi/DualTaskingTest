    In this study you will be tasked to take 8 tests. The shapes appear one by one, their position are randomized within the box below, and the duration 
    for which they appear is decreased for every set of 4 tests.
    <br><br>
    In the first phase your task is to keep a seperate track on the amount of squares and circles shown, and in the second phase your task is to only 
    keep track on the amount of circles shown. Interval and current task is also shown below the test.
    <br><br>
    You are to only use your mind to keep track of the counts, no pen or paper.
